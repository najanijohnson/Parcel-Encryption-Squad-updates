This is turning into a document of all the things I have learned while using Shiny:

List of resources for helping us implement our website. A few of these I have used
in the past in highschool. - Meghan

- https://www.w3schools.com/
- w3 schools is good for finding specific syntax for javascript, html and contains resources
that we might want to look into

- https://codehs.com/
- codehs is what I used when learning html and javascript in high school

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
- this one is pretty good too but I would rather use w3 schools because this one just has a ton of words

- How to test the actual file itself (the .html file)
    - drag the file from the file explorer on the side (it should just show the repo name in vscode its usually on the left side)
    - drag it into any internet browser
    - to see recent changes make sure to save your file and REFRESH the website that is loaded
    - keep in mind that this is just locally hosting it, there is no server the data is coming from
    - 

- Do not forget to install the .html extensions for vscode and the javascript extensions too

- good for outlines and templates: https://github.com/bradtraversy/design-resources-for-developers#html--css-templates 

- javascript is kinda like our logical implementation vs HTML which is like our outline
- HTML is the bread to hold the website together while javascript is our actual sandwhich ingredients
- javascript is very similar to c imo, it isnt crazy, but it has to be implemented within the HTML code itself
- CSS may be helpful, it just makes the website look nice but its in the programming style of HTML
so it can be very tedious

- Webassembly might be worth looking into, its a method that helps run languages like C instead of javascript

-compiling notes:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-using wsl -> shiny
just make sure youre in teh correct environment & directory
shiny run --reload app.py


To do: (-m)
-   bug fixes
        -   fixed the one of not isolating the react calls for customer and package retrieval partner.
                -   i dont know the main cause still however, setting the all reacts when calling 
                for either one seems to work and doesnt clear local vars but instead clears the actual
                calls themselves. i dont know what they are actually called but that is what i am calling
                them for now
-   add constraints for when users click package retieval and register new buisness
        -   check that it is a valid email address
        -   if not please follow correct syntax
        -   password must also be 8 characters long 
        -   any empty field gives an error message
        -   make sure the buisness agreement doesnt pop up nless those error messages are resolved
