List of resources for helping us implement our website. A few of these I have used
in the past in highschool.
- https://www.w3schools.com/
- w3 schools is good for finding specific syntax for javascript, html and contains resources
that we might want to look into
- https://codehs.com/
- codehs is what I used when learning html and javascript in high school
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
- this one is pretty good too but I would rather use w3 schools because this one just has a ton of words
