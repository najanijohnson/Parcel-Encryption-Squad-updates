List of resources for helping us implement our website. A few of these I have used
in the past in highschool. - Meghan

- https://www.w3schools.com/
- w3 schools is good for finding specific syntax for javascript, html and contains resources
that we might want to look into

- https://codehs.com/
- codehs is what I used when learning html and javascript in high school

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
- this one is pretty good too but I would rather use w3 schools because this one just has a ton of words

- How to test the actual file itself (the .html file)
    - drag the file from the file explorer on the side (it should just show the repo name in vscode its usually on the left side)
    - drag it into any internet browser
    - to see recent changes make sure to save your file and REFRESH the website that is loaded
    - keep in mind that this is just locally hosting it, there is no server the data is coming from
    - 

- Do not forget to install the .html extensions for vscode and the javascript extensions too

- good for outlines and templates: https://github.com/bradtraversy/design-resources-for-developers#html--css-templates 

- javascript is kinda like our logical implementation vs HTML which is like our outline
- HTML is the bread to hold the website together while javascript is our actual sandwhich ingredients
- javascript is very similar to c imo, it isnt crazy, but it has to be implemented within the HTML code itself
- CSS may be helpful, it just makes the website look nice but its in the programming style of HTML
so it can be very tedious

- Webassembly might be worth looking into, its a method that helps run languages like C instead of javascript
